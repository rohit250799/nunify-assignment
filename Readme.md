Logical breakdown of the given problem and its solution:

1. Parsing of the input:

    a) We start by reading the dimensions of the warehouse 
    b) then, reading the initial position and movement commands for each robot in the warehouse

2. Dealing with the robot directions:
    
    a) Use a list of directions (N, E, S, W) to determine rotation with each character representing a particular direction
    b) afterwards, using a dictionary to keep track of changes in movement based on the directions

    Using modular arithmetic for ensuring that when the index goes below 0, it wraps around to the end of the list which in turn, 
    makes the directions behave like a circle. 

    Example: Assuming a list of directions, the indices are:

    N -> 0
    E -> 1
    S -> 2
    W -> 3

    If we're at 'N' (index 0) and turn left, we go "backward" in the list. Normally, subtracting 1 would give -1,
    which is invalid for list indices.

    Therefore, by Using (index - 1) % 4, -1 becomes 3 because % wraps it around to the last index.

    Thus, the list has been made circular - if we go right from 'N' it leads to 'E'. Similarly, going right from 'E' will 
    lead to 'S'


3. Handling commands:

    a) Rotating left or right based on commands L and R using the direction list from the input
    b) Moving forward in the current direction if input = M and updating the robot position on the grid
    c) Also, keeping a track of the warehouse boundaries (rectangular) - so, the robots don't cross them
